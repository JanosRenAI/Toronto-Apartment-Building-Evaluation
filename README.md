## Evaluating Apartment Building Conditions in Toronto

## Overview
This paper analyzes the Toronto Apartment Building Evaluation dataset to assess the conditions of apartment buildings across various neighborhoods in the city. Main factors explored include evaluation scores, building age, and the number of tenant complaints. The aim is to determine if certain neighborhoods or older buildings exhibit lower evaluations or higher complaints, which could indicate areas requiring focused improvements. Through data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, trends in apartment conditions are examined, providing insights that can assist in policy-making and resource allocation for building maintenance in Toronto.
