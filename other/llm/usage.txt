#### Workspace setup ####
#install.packages("tidyverse")

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

#### Simulate data ####

# Number of apartment buildings
num_samples <- 1000

# Simulate data columns
apartment_id <- 1:num_samples
building_age <- sample(10:100, num_samples, replace = TRUE)  # Age of the building in years
rating <- round(runif(num_samples, 1, 5), 1)  # Ratings between 1 and 5
num_complaints <- rpois(num_samples, lambda = 3)  # Number of complaints (average = 3)
num_units <- sample(10:300, num_samples, replace = TRUE)  # Number of units in the building
neighborhood <- sample(c("Downtown", "Midtown", "Uptown", "East End", "West End"), num_samples, replace = TRUE)
recent_renovation <- sample(c("Yes", "No"), num_samples, replace = TRUE)  # Recent renovation status

# Combine into a data frame
simulated_data <- data.frame(
  apartment_id,
  building_age,
  rating,
  num_complaints,
  num_units,
  neighborhood,
  recent_renovation
)

# Print first few rows of simulated data
print(head(simulated_data))

#### Data Validation Tests ####

# Test: Check if the number of rows matches the expected number of samples
stopifnot(nrow(simulated_data) == num_samples)

# Test: Check if ratings are within the expected range
stopifnot(all(simulated_data$rating >= 1 & simulated_data$rating <= 5))

# Test: Check if building age is within the expected range
stopifnot(all(simulated_data$building_age >= 10 & simulated_data$building_age <= 100))

#### Save simulated data ####
write.csv(simulated_data, "downloads\\simulated_data.csv")

Error in mutate():
ℹ In argument: recent_renovation = ifelse(YEAR.RENOVATED >= (2024 - 5), "Yes",
  "No").
Caused by error:
! object 'YEAR.RENOVATED' not found
Run rlang::last_trace() to see where the error occurred.

The error message indicates that the column YEAR.RENOVATED does not exist in your data1 dataframe. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

Steps to Troubleshoot
Check Existing Columns: First, confirm the names of all columns in your data1 dataframe to identify what renovation-related data is available.

Determine the Correct Column: Find the column that contains the renovation year or equivalent information.

Adjust Code Accordingly: Based on the correct column name, modify the code to create the recent_renovation column.

Example Code
Here’s how you can proceed:

r
Copy code
# Print the column names of the dataframe
print(colnames(data1))

# Identify the column that represents the renovation year
# Replace 'YOUR_RENOVATION_YEAR_COLUMN' with the actual column name found
# For example, if the column is called 'renovation_year'
data1 <- data1 %>%
  mutate(recent_renovation = ifelse(renovation_year >= (2024 - 5), "Yes", "No"))  # Adjust according to actual column name

# Check the new 'recent_renovation' column
print(table(data1$recent_renovation))

# Proceed with the plotting code as before
data1 %>%
  group_by(neighborhood, recent_renovation) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(percentage = count / sum(count) * 100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = neighborhood, y = percentage, fill = recent_renovation)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Buildings with Recent Renovations by Neighborhood",
       x = "Neighborhood",
       y = "Percentage",
       fill = "Recent Renovation")
Explanation of the Code Adjustments
Print Column Names: The line print(colnames(data1)) allows you to see the available columns in your dataframe. This helps you determine what data is available for the renovation year.

Update the Column Reference: Replace renovation_year in the mutate() function with the actual name of the column that contains the renovation year data.

Check and Plot: After creating the recent_renovation column, the plotting code can be reused as-is.

Conclusion
After making these adjustments, your code should work without errors. If you encounter further issues, please provide the output of print(colnames(data1)), so I can assist you more effectively!
